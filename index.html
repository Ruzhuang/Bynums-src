            <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Bynum’s game is a two-person game where the starting position is a grid of squares. &nbsp The following 6x8 grid is used to illustrate the rules:
            </p>
            <div class="img-wrapper">
                <img id="img1" src="images/grid68.png" alt="6 x 8 grid">
                <div class="loader" id="loader1">
                    <p>Loading</p>
                    <div class="spin"></div>
                </div>
            </div>
            <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspBefore the game starts, the size of the grid (height x width) must be selected by responding to the following dialog box: </p>
            <div class="img-wrapper">
                <img id="img2" src="images/set_grid.png" alt="set grid page">
                <div class="loader" id="loader2">
                    <p>Loading</p>
                    <div class="spin"></div>
                </div>
            </div>
            <p>One player (female) is named <em id="blue">Left</em> and the other (male) is named <em id="orange">Right</em>.</p>
            <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThe game begins when <em id="blue">Left</em> makes the first move. <em id="blue">Left</em> is required to remove any column of squares from the starting position. She does so by clicking anywhere on the column she wishes
                to remove.</p>
            <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspHere we see that <em id="blue">Left</em> has removed the 3rd column:</p>
            <div class="img-wrapper">
                <img id="img3" src="images/first_click.gif" alt="LEFT's first click">
                <div class="loader" id="loader3">
                    <p>Loading</p>
                    <div class="spin"></div>
                </div>
            </div>
            <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp <em id="blue">Left's</em> first move splits the game board into two parts, A and B. Now it is <em id="orange">Right's</em> turn.</p>
            <div class="img-wrapper">
                <img id="img4" src="images/AandB.png" alt="part A and part B">
                <div class="loader" id="loader4">
                    <p>Loading</p>
                    <div class="spin"></div>
                </div>
            </div>
            <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp<em id="orange">Right</em> makes move #2 by removing a row from either part A or part B. This is done by clicking anywhere on the row.</p>
            <div class="img-wrapper">
                <img id="img5" src="images/second_click.gif" alt="RIGHT's click">
                <div class="loader" id="loader5">
                    <p>Loading</p>
                    <div class="spin"></div>
                </div>
            </div>
            <p>Here we see that <em id="orange">Right</em> made move #2 by eliminating row #3 from part B above. Here is the result: </p>
            <div class="img-wrapper">
                <img id="img6" src="images/ABC.png" alt="part A, B and C">
                <div class="loader" id="loader6">
                    <p>Loading</p>
                    <div class="spin"></div>
                </div>
            </div>
            <p>Now it is <em id="blue">Left's</em> turn.</p>
            <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp<strong>REMEMBER:</strong> <em id="blue">Left</em> always removes <i>columns</i> and <em id="orange">Right</em> removes <i>rows</i>.</p>
            <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspFor move #3, <em id="blue">Left</em> must move in one of the 3 parts that appeared in the previous diagram (A, B, or C), etc. The following diagram shows that she has decided to remove the 3rd column of B, etc.</p>
            <div class="img-wrapper">
                <img id="img7" src="images/third_click.gif" alt="LEFT's click">
                <div class="loader" id="loader7">
                    <p>Loading</p>
                    <div class="spin"></div>
                </div>
            </div>
            <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThe game goes on like this; And, eventually, the 6x8 starting position is completely erased.The game is won by the player who makes the last legal move. That is, if it happens to be your turn and nothing remains on the
                board, then you lose!</p>
            <p><i class="important">&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspHowever, our modified version of Bynum's game imposes the following additional restriction:</i></p>
            <p><i>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspA single row or column that is no longer attached to any other part is said to be “isolated”.  Such rows or columns are automatically erased once they are generated by a move.</i></p>
            <p><i>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspFirst Example:</i>&nbsp Now <em id="orange">Right</em> must move in the following position: (Suppose he chooses the part where the 3 rows are numbered.)</p>
            <div class="img-wrapper">
                <img id="img8" src="images/isorow.png" alt="An isolated row gets erased">
                <div class="loader" id="loader8">
                    <p>Loading</p>
                    <div class="spin"></div>
                </div>
            </div>
            <p> Note that erasing row #1 is equivalent to erasing row #3 (in either case, a 2X5 part is generated). However, if <em id="orange">Right</em> clicks on row #2, then both #1 and #3 become isolated; hence the entire 3x5 part gets wiped out.</p>
            <div class="img-wrapper">
                <img id="img9" src="images/isorow.gif" alt="An isolated row gets erased">
                <div class="loader" id="loader9">
                    <p>Loading</p>
                    <div class="spin"></div>
                </div>
            </div>
            <p><i>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspSecond Example:</i>&nbspSuppose the 3x5 part (above) is wiped out, so <em id="blue">Left</em> must now play in the following:</p>
            <div class="img-wrapper">
                <img id="img10" src="images/isocolumn.png" alt="An isolated column gets erased">
                <div class="loader" id="loader10">
                    <p>Loading</p>
                    <div class="spin"></div>
                </div>
            </div>
            <p> Each of the remaining 3 parts has 2 columns only. When <em id="blue">Left</em> clicks on a column (in any of the 3), the single column that remains also disappears due to its isolation. </p>
            <div class="img-wrapper">
                <img id="img11" src="images/isocolumn.gif" alt="An isolated column gets erased">
                <div class="loader" id="loader11">
                    <p>Loading</p>
                    <div class="spin"></div>
                </div>
            </div>
